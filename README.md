Scrape Twitter and scrape data such from public Twitter profiles. Collect data on URLs, hashtags, images, videos, tweets, retweets, conversation threads, followers/following, locations, and more

Tweepy is a Python library for integrating with the Twitter API. Because Tweepy is connected with the Twitter API, you can perform complex queries in addition to scraping tweets. It enables you to take advantage of all of the Twitter API's capabilities
